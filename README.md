# Final_year_Project
The **Dental Shade Prediction App** is a Flask-based web application that uses a pre-trained SVM model to predict dental shades from uploaded images. The app processes the image by extracting specific RGB values from regions of interest and uses these features to classify the closest dental shade. It then provides detailed information about the predicted shade, including its CIE L*a*b* color values, tone, similar shades, and the corresponding 3D Master shade equivalent. This functionality helps dental professionals and enthusiasts quickly assess color matching for dental procedures.

The app is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. Users can upload an image via a straightforward web interface, and the app performs the necessary image processing and prediction in real-time. The system leverages popular Python libraries like Flask, OpenCV, NumPy, and Pandas to handle the backend, while the model is stored in a pickle file, allowing easy integration of machine learning-based predictions. This project showcases the power of machine learning in the field of dentistry, particularly for shade matching, and can be further expanded for more advanced applications.
